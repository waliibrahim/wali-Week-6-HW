	  <!-- Comments: 
	  It's good to see your work, Wali, and I have your prototype / sketch page included in your total grade, as it gave you extra credit. 
	  I was wondering if you had made this into a github pages site, per the directions (which would also require the home webpage to be re-named index.html. 
	  A few issues that could have been resolved before homework submission using the W3 validator, included a missing opener <body> tag & the closing of the </head> tag before the style information was included. The order & opening / closing tags are crucial and may be part of the mid-term exam, so please try to proofread your work with that in mind. 
	  Comments, per the grading rubric can be seen below. 
	  
DTD, head, body: missing body opener tag.
at least 2 html semantic elements for parts of html page:  <header> & <footer> but <footer> should be at bottom of page, also semantically, have only 1 h1 level tag
at least 1 list  in content: yes
at least 1 image / video in page (no copyright violation): yes
External stylesheet referenced by website: sort of - yes, a link tag there, but no external stylesheet used, only in-page/internal styles & no external stylesheet uploaded to Github
